# Architected Nork

This repository contains two versions of a simple text-based game called Nork, developed as part of a [course](http://arch-joelross.rhcloud.com/) at the UW iSchool. 

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission!


##### 1. Did you work with a partner? If so, who?
> I (Jimmy Nguyen) worked with Linnea Watson.



##### 2. Discuss how the different architectural styles affected the implementation of your program. Was one pattern easier to use or more effective _for this problem_? Why? How do the different styles influence the ability to add new features or modify existing functionality? What kind of changes would be easier or harder with each style?
##### This discussion should be a couple of paragraphs, giving a detailed analysis of how the styles work.
> Answer goes here!



##### 3. Did you add an extra features to either version of your game? If so, what?
> Linnea: I allowed the user the option to quit after submitting invalid input more than two times.

> Jimmy: I added a help feature that displays all of the commands for the game to the user in the pipe-and-filter implementation. I also added a feature that removes consumable items from the inventory upon use. 



##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Jimmy: It took me about 10-13 hours to implement the pipe-and-filter architecture for this game.



##### 5. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Jimmy: I worked with Kendall Reonal to dsiscuss pipe-and-filters. 



##### 6. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Jimmy: Mentioning that using a pipe-and-filter architecture is not the best way to design this game in the assignment specs, like how it was mentioned in lecture, would had cleared up some confusion I had at the start.
